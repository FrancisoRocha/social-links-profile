## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

### Screenshot

![](![alt text](image.png))

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

### Continued development

In future projects, I want to continue focusing on the following areas to refine my skills and gain a deeper understanding:

Responsive Design: While Iâ€™ve gained confidence in creating layouts that adapt to various screen sizes, I aim to further refine my approach, particularly in optimizing images and managing complex grid systems for even better performance across all devices.

JavaScript Interactivity: Enhancing user experience through dynamic content is something I find exciting. I plan to explore more advanced JavaScript techniques, including animations, event handling, and possibly diving deeper into frameworks like React to build more interactive and engaging web applications.

Accessibility: Ensuring that my websites are accessible to everyone is a priority. I want to deepen my knowledge of web accessibility standards (WCAG) and implement them more thoroughly in my designs, focusing on improving navigation, color contrast, and screen reader compatibility.

Performance Optimization: Speed is crucial for user experience. I will continue to focus on optimizing my code for faster load times, including practices like code splitting, lazy loading, and minimizing resource requests.

CSS Grid and Flexbox: While Iâ€™ve utilized CSS Grid and Flexbox for layout creation, I want to master these tools further, especially in more complex scenarios, to create sophisticated, flexible designs with ease.
